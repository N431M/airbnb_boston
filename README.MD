## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Boston Airbnb Open Data

from 2016-2017 to better understand:

Find negative and positive reviews based on text?
Try to understand if there is anything about the properties that helps you predict price.
How much AirBnB earning in certain time frames?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@nazim.dzh/the-start-of-my-data-science-journey-c8212189c267?sk=af5dd2072c80d60cd44ca451af1b9be4).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to AirBnB for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston?select=reviews.csv).
